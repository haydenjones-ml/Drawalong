# Drawalong - Your Lightweight Drawing App

Collaborative whiteboard built with SDL and the Windows Socket API
## Why?
I was reading [Beej's Guide To Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) and went "wow, I wonder what I can build to implement these principles?" before settling on making a digital, real-time whiteboard.

## Fun Features:
- TCP Stream via Winsock2 API for quick and accurate communication
- Custom Bresenham's algorithm implementation for deterministic line drawing
- Color changing via RGB values

## Keybind Guide:
- (E): Toggle Eraser
- (=): Increase Brush/Eraser Size
- (-): Decrease Brush/Eraser Size

## How do I use this?
Just download the .ZIP file (Green 'Code' button in the top right -> Download ZIP) and run the 'drawalong.exe' file. To connect via...
- **Host:** type 'h' in the terminal and wait for a client connection
- **Client:** type 'c' and type the IPv4 Address of the host
- **Offline:** just type 'o' :)

## For TODO: Check Issues :) Thanks for checking this out!
